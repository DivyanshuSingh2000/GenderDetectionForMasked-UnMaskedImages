The image clearly shows how our model work , we defined 3 model and how they are used to detect mask and gender in real time.

First face masked detection model is created, that will detect mask on face of an individual. If there is mask on face then gender is detected. Models created for this part is in folder "Model Fusion For Masked Images". And if there is no mask on face then gender is detected for those images, model for this task is in folder "Model For Unmasked Images".
